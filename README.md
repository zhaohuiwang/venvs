### Goals
This repo is organized with some shared virtual environments (venv) across projects. 
Instead of creating individual `.venv` directory (some with size > 5 Gigabyte) inside of each project directory, I organized some venvs in this shared directory to reduce the memory usage. The path is listed in the README.md file inside the each venv directory.
